## Is this against Discord's ToS?
Theoretically no. We are not modifying discord, we are literally just wrapping it on a more light app. Looks like discord doesn't care too much about clients cause betterdiscord and other modified clients are still up and working fine. However i can't promise nothing.

## Developer guide
Please refer to the [Building](BUILDING.md) page to learn how to build discord-lite from sources and contribute.
